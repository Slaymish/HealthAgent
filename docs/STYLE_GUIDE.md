# HealthAgent Frontend Style Guide

A short north star for UI decisions.

## Product intent

HealthAgent is a decision interface, not a dashboard. It should answer:

1) Am I on track?
2) What changed?
3) What should I do next?

## Principles

- Action > information
- Trends > snapshots
- Progressive disclosure
- Narrative first, numbers as evidence
- Calm, not compulsive

## Voice

- Calm, concise, practical
- Neutral, non-moralizing
- Coach-like, not judge-like

Examples:
- “You’re trending slightly above target.”
- “Sleep consistency dipped midweek.”
- “One change: add a 20-minute walk after lunch.”

## UI priorities

1) Overall status
2) Recent change
3) Key levers
4) Goal context
5) Deep dives

## Headline metrics (keep it small)

- Weight trend + rate
- Calories + protein vs target
- Steps/activity floor
- Sleep duration + consistency
- Training frequency
- Recovery proxy (RHR/HRV if reliable)

## Anti-goals

- Full Apple Health mirror
- Gamified streaks/XP
- Chatty AI coach UI
- Overwhelming dashboard vibes
